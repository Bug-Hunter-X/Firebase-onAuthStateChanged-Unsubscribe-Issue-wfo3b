# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Unsubscribe Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The unsubscribe function, intended to remove the listener, does not always function as expected, causing potential problems.

## Problem Description
The provided `authBug.js` file shows an implementation where the `unsubscribe` function, obtained from `onAuthStateChanged`, fails to reliably detach the listener.  This leads to the callback function executing repeatedly and causing unexpected behavior, such as redundant state updates and memory leaks.

## Solution
The `authBugSolution.js` provides a corrected implementation that addresses the unsubscribe issue. It demonstrates proper usage of the `unsubscribe` function within a cleanup mechanism to ensure the listener is reliably detached when no longer needed.  Additional context may be needed for complete problem reproduction depending on application setup.
